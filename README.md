# Sol-Mail

Sol-Mail is a self-hosted file and message submission portal. It provides a simple and secure way for users to send files and messages to a central administrator, making it an ideal solution for scenarios like collecting assignments, receiving project files, or any situation where secure, one-way submission is needed.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Your data, your server. Full control over your information.
- **Simple Submission Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI for users to submit files and messages.
- **Centralized Reception**: All submissions are sent to a single admin account for easy management.
- **Secure**: Uses modern, token-based authentication for user access.
- **Lightweight**: Built with Bun, ensuring fast performance and a minimal footprint.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own Sol-Mail instance up and running in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- You must have **[Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)** installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get the source code onto your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wxn0brP/sol-mail.git
cd sol-mail
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file. This file may contain default settings or placeholders for required variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Run the Automated Setup

We've created a single command to handle all the necessary setup steps, from installing dependencies to building the frontend.

```bash
bun run setup:bun
```

This command performs the following actions for you:
- Installs the required backend dependencies.
- Installs the required frontend dependencies.
- Builds the frontend application and places it in the correct directory to be served.

### 4. Start the Server

Now, you can start the application server.

```bash
bun run bun
```

This will launch the backend server, which handles the API and serves the web interface. By default, it should be running at `http://localhost:19851`.

### 5. Create Your First User

To log in, you first need to create a user account.

```bash
bun run scripts/create_user.ts
```

### 6. Add Admin User

```bash
bun run scripts/add_admin.ts <username>
```

## For Developers
